ColorClash
ColorClash is a fast-paced web-based game where players navigate a colorful circle to match falling blocks. The game challenges players' reflexes and color-matching skills as they attempt to keep up with the increasing difficulty.

Gameplay
In ColorClash, your goal is to maneuver a colorful circle to catch falling blocks that match the color displayed in the target area at the top right of the screen. Each correct match earns you points, while missing the correct block or allowing any block to reach the bottom without matching will result in a game over.

Features
Dynamic Gameplay: Move the circle with arrow keys or touch controls to match the falling blocks.
Color Matching: Align the circle with blocks of the target color displayed in the top right corner.
Increasing Difficulty: Blocks fall faster as you score more points, adding to the challenge.
Responsive Design: The game adapts to various screen sizes and works on both desktop and mobile devices.
Game Over Mechanics: If a block reaches the bottom without being matched, or if a wrong color block is caught, the game ends.
Controls
Desktop: Use the arrow keys to move the circle (left, right, up, down).
Mobile: Drag the circle with your finger to move it around the screen.
How to Play

Move the Circle: Use the arrow keys (or drag on mobile) to position the circle.
Match Colors: Align the circle with the falling blocks that match the target color.
